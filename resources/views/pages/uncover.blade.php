            <p>When life gets crazy and responsibilities at home and work pile one on top of the other, it’s easy to let our health and fitness slip. The years go by and we don’t even realize how much our health has declined.</p>
            <p>But for most of us, there comes a time when we realize things must change. A time when gaining control over our body takes on new urgency. For some, it’s a scary health diagnosis. For others it’s watching a loved one struggle with their own health problems. And for others still, it’s when they finally realize they’ve spent so many years taking care of others, that they neglected to take care of themselves.</p>
            <p>When it’s time to turn things around and start a new health and fitness program, however, it can be difficult to know what to do next. And staying motivated is hard—especially if you try to do it all on your own. That’s where we come in. Our goal is to help you get in the best shape of your life and stay that way, starting now, through our Uncover Your Fit program.</p>

Then, over the course of the program, we’ll give you everything you need to look, feel, and perform better than you thought possible. Instead of the all-or-nothing dieting approach, we use a sustainable, practice-based approach to build healthy habits into your life, one day at a time. The result? You’ll lose the weight (and inches) you haven’t been able to shed for years. Whatever obstacles arise, we’ll help you overcome them by modifying your program or offering new solutions.</p>

After all, self-directed training and nutrition programs fail 98 percent of the time. Not to mention, after many years in the fitness industry, we’ve seen dozens of diet and exercise fads come and go. That’s why we don’t follow fads.

        <!--<p>Whether you know it or not, most, if not all, your daily activities were learned through habit-based learning. For example, you learned to write with one hand by using that hand repeatedly. You also developed a showering preference by repeatedly showering at a specific time of day.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s writing, showering, or some other daily ritual, the way it became part of your daily routine was through ease of completion and repetition. If something is easy to do, and you do it repeatedly (habitually), it will become part of your daily routine (habit). For healthy habits, such as brushing your teeth, habit-based learning is great. However, for unhealthy habits, like being sedentary and eating too much, habit-based learning is terrible.</p>
        <p>Most of us don’t consciously choose to learn unhealthy habits; rather, we learn them because they are easy to do and fit nicely into our daily schedules. For example, many people develop the unhealthy habit of eating fast food everyday because it is easier than bringing lunch from home (i.e. easy to do), and it’s quick (i.e., it fits easily in their schedule).</p>
        <p>At the same time, when we want to learn a new healthy habit, such as eating a healthy diet or exercising regularly, it must also be easy to do and fit in our schedule, or it won’t stick long term. This is the primary reason why the health and fitness programs you have tried in the past have failed. They weren’t easy to do, such as eating food you didn’t like, and they weren’t easy to keep in your schedule for the long term.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center text-secondary">Your Future</h2>
        <p>Let’s put your past attempts where they belong, in the past, and look to your future with Find Your Fit. Using this one-year program, you will gradually modify small elements of your diet and fitness routines. These changes will be small, easy to complete, and will easily fit into your schedule. By utilizing this approach, these changes will become part of your overall daily routine rather than just some program you do and as a result, will allow you to maintain your new healthy habits for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>As you complete Find Your Fit and modify your habits, you will:</p>
            <ul class="mt-2">
