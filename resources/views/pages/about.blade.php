        <p>Your health and fitness are a direct result of your daily habits. If you habitually stress about life’s events, you will become a stressed-out person. At the same time, if you habitually overeat or fail to get some physical exercise, you will gain weight and ultimately develop health problems. Because habits play such a key role in your health and fitness, they are the focus of our coaching approach at Uncover Your Fit.</p>
        <p>The key thing to remember about habits, however, is that the person you currently are is the result of your habits over time. You didn’t go to sleep yesterday a healthy and fit person then wake up today overweight, out of shape, and experiencing health problems. Rather, your personal habits developed over months, years, and possibly decades. Some poor health habits you might have developed in your life include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eating too much</li>
                <li>Drinking too much alcohol</li>
                <li>Eating the wrong foods</li>
                <li>Not exercising regularly</li>
                <li>Letting life stress you out</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you are like most people, you have tried many ways to address your less than optimal lifestyle habits, and if you're like most people, your efforts have not yielded the long-term results you desire. The reason your past efforts were not the greatest is because most diet and exercise plans focus mainly on rapid change in the short term. You can only eat rice cakes and follow a strict meal plan for so long before you break and go on an eating spree. At the same time, if you don’t see immediate results, you start to lose your motivation. For example, you might eat well and exercise regularly for a month and only see minimal weight loss or body composition changes. When this happens, most people give up because the results are not worth the effort.</p>
        <p>Guess what, you can forget the past because no matter where you are currently in life Uncover Your Fit can help. We are different than other coaches and personal trainers because we focus on changing your long-term habits rather than making drastic unsustainable short-term changes to your diet and exercise. Will our habit-based approach lead to quick results? No, just as it took you months or years for your current habits to form the person you are today, it will take time to develop new sustainable habits.</p>
        <p>Our habit-based coaching approach, though not rapid, will finally provide you long-term results. Every few weeks, we will make small changes to your nutrition and fitness habits. Then, as you master each small habit, we will slowly add new ones. As your program progresses, the combined effect of your mastered habits will lead to the lifestyle changes you have always desired. Best of all, these lifestyle changes will be sustainable for the long term because you took the time to slowly develop them. No longer will your habits just be part of some diet or exercise routine you do; they will be a part of who you are.</p>
