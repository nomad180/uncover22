                    <li>The 12-month coaching program that's helping our clients transform their lives and get off the diet roller coaster once and for all without the need to follow a draconian diet or fitness plan</li>
                    <li>Why "quick fix" self-directed exercise and nutrition programs fail 98% of the time</li>
                    <li>How raising self awareness about your health and wellness is key to helping you transform both your nutrition and fitness habitsâ€”once you understand why you do something, it is much easier to change</li>
                    <li>Why our habit-based coaching program focuses on turning small practices into daily habits</li>
                    <li>How your new habits will merge over the course of the 12-month program to form sustainable lifestyle changes that will no longer soley be part of some diet or exercise routine you do; rather, they will be part of who you are</li>
